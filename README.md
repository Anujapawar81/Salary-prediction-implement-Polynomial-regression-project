# Salary-prediction-implement-Polynomial-regression-project

**Objective**

The objective of this project the HR team of a company uses to determine what salary to offer to a new employee. For our project, let's take an example that an employee has applied for the role of a Regional Manager and has already worked as a Regional Manager for 2 years. he falls between level 6 and level 7 - Lets say he falls under level 6.5. Build a model to predict what salary offer to a new employee.

**Methodology**

**Data Preparation:**

•	Import necessary packages in Jupyter Notebook.

•	Extract and load the dataset and copy the data.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

The first step in EDA was to visualize the relationships between variables. the correlation between the variables can be visualized with the help of scatterplot Identify and handle incorrect 0 values in the dataset.

**Feature Selection:**

Choose Level as independent variables for predicting Salary.

**Model Building:**

•	Create a  linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.

•	Create a Polynomial regression model using Scikit-Learn.

**Visual Representation:**

•	Use Linear Model and Visualise the Plot.

•	Use Polynomial Regression and Visualise the Plot Properly. with the help of scatterplot & ragplot.

**Model Evaluation:**

•	Assess the model's performance using the R-squared (r2_score).

**Conclusion**

By using Polynomial Regression, the predicted salary is one hundred and fifty eight. Well actually one hundred fifty nine thousand dollars which is super close to the salary mentioned by this person. using Linear regression model. we got the prediction of 330k and by using polynomial regression we got the prediction 158k.
So, according to the analysis, the polynomial regression is most efficient for the prediction of salary of the employees.
